👋 Hello there, I'm @Zereixus!

👀 With a passion for Microcontrollers and Data, I'm constantly intrigued by the dynamic intersection of science, engineering, and computing. I find immense joy in exploring the intricacies of Microcontrollers, delving into the world of Data Science, and mastering the art of Data Engineering.

🌱 Currently, I'm immersed in a fascinating learning journey, honing my skills in prominent Data languages such as MySQL, Python, and C++. These tools empower me to unravel the mysteries hidden within datasets and to craft innovative solutions that harness the power of data.

💞️ I'm actively seeking opportunities to collaborate with like-minded individuals who share my enthusiasm for technology, innovation, and the limitless possibilities that emerge when we blend Microcontrollers and Data.

📫 If you're excited about these topics as much as I am and would like to connect, collaborate, or simply have a stimulating conversation, feel free to reach out to me at zereixuslincoln@gmail.com. Let's embark on a journey of exploration and creativity together!
